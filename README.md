# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum by Yandex. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.
This project utilizes CSS to create some cool animations. It also includes a form with customized styling and iframs to embed YouTube videos.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

In the future I would like to further develop this website by adding a more customized menu. For example clicking on a product in the menu would expand the menu and show nutritional info regarding that product. This probably requires some javascript.
